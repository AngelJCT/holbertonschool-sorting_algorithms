# Sorting algorithms & Big O
### Sorting algorithms are a set of techniques that can be used to rearrange a list of items in a particular order. The order can be either ascending or descending, and the items can be numbers, strings, or any other type of data that can be compared.

### There are many different sorting algorithms, each with its own set of trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and other factors. Some common sorting algorithms include:

#### Bubble sort: This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order.
#### Insertion sort: This algorithm works by iterating through the list and inserting each element into its correct position in a new, sorted list.
#### Selection sort: This algorithm selects the smallest element in the list and moves it to the front, then repeats the process with the remaining elements.
#### Quick sort: This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach, partitioning the list around a pivot element and recursively sorting the sublists on either side of the pivot.

### There are many other sorting algorithms as well, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of which algorithm to use can depend on the specific characteristics of the data being sorted, as well as the requirements of the application.

***3-quick_sort.c***

<sub>Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm. You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme. The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted. You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.</sub>
